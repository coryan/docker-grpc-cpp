# Configure the project using CMake. Some of the options are unusual:
#   -GNinja: use Ninja as the backend as this is often faster than Make.
#   -CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=...: use the packages installed via vcpkg.
#   -DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=ON: prefer static over shared libraries for Boost.
#   -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=...: create statically linked binaries.
