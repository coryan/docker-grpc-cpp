# Install the typical development tools and some additions:
#   - curl, perl, unzip and tar are needed by vcpkg to compile dependencies,
#     such as gRPC, that do not have Ubuntu packages.
#   - ninja-build is a backend for CMake that often compiles faster than
#     CMake with GNU Make.
#   - Install the boost libraries.
